<h1><b><u>Program Functionality</u></b></h1>
This program currently will ask the user how many tweets they want to scrape for, then will ask them whcih stock ticker they
want to look for within those tweets.
<p></p>
The program will then take any links that are within those tweets and open each one in a new tab in the default web browser.
<p></p>
<h4>Feb 3, 2021 EDIT: The program now will filter out duplicate links, opening only unique links.</h4>
<h1><b><u>Program Limitations</u></b></h1>
<p>Some limitations of the program include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not all the tweets will have links, so if someone searches for 100 tweets, they usually only get 60-80 links.</li>
  <li>Not all of the links are articles. Alot of them lead back to the tweet itself, but can still be useful to see who is talking about that stock.</li>
  <li>The number of tabs that can be opened is constrained to the performance of the computer, as the browser can only handle opening so many tabs at once before the browser crashes.</li>
</ul>
